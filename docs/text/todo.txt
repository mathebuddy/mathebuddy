<h3>Known bugs / limitations / design issues</h3>

- compiler: update index file implementation according to new grammar
- grammar.txt files are out of date
- Debug option: show complete chapter at once (e.g. for PDF export)
- must update MBL and SMPL documentation
- VSCode simulator plugin: fix CSP via nonce (https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/126977)
- public courses: include new features
- level overview icons are still too small (max 3 columns or horizontal scrolling?)
- larger exercises should be split up, with possibility to evaluate parts of it
- SMPL code "let phi = randZ(-1,1)\*pi/rand({2,3,6});" is generated to TeX (e.g.) "\frac{-pi}{3}" instead of "-\frac{pi}{3}"
- SMPL code should allow to include the students answer for evaluation
- keyboards should open automatically, if there is only one exercise in the current view
- automatically move to the next input field after pressing the "enter" key
- repeat-exercise button must draw instances that are distinct to prior ones
- keyboard input field: if the input is longer than the field, things become strange..
- "-1-2-3" on keyboard is rendered as "1 + -2 + -3"
- missing navigation button to (default) next level (at the end of the current level)
- CAS is still limited/buggy (in some "circumstances": decimal representation instead of symbolic terms, e.g. "1.57..." instead of "pi/2"; or "1/2+1" instead of "3/2"); known bugs are marked by "work-in-progess"-texts
- the context-sensitive keyboard for answers is too restricted in some cases; especially polar form input is currently not yet available; known bugs are marked by "work-in-progess"-texts
- the TeX-engine is inaccurate in spacing. E.g. "\left{1,2,3\right}" is really ugly...
- scoring is not persisted
- chatbot (that asks randomized questions) is not yet present
- "events" are not yet gamified
- "\" in TeX strings is corrupted by MBL in some cases (e.g. "x \ dx"): must emit spaces by Lexer while parsing paragraphs
- solutions hints: e.g. number of correct element in a set, or feedback which part solutions are correct in exercises with multiple input fields
- compiler: output warning/error for duplicate labels
- support for multiple course languages in MBL
- simulator website: enable typing answers on host keyboard
- support for "build-term: true" in exercises (front end)
- MBL: allow \\ for paragraph distinction (in addition to an empty line)
- assets issues with google fonts / app does not run offline due to roboto google fonts!!

<h3>Implemented, but not yet online (newest items first)</h3>

(list is currently empty)

<h3>Fixed (newest items first)</h3>

- implementation: integrate directory /doc/ into directory /docs/
- refactored complete app code
- "Navigator" is now used to push/pop app pages
- pressing on "DEBUG" (or "RELEASE") in the title bar switches between debug and release mode.
- some buttons have confused testers.
  (a) The exercise passed/OK check now has no border and thus does not seem to be a clickable button any longer
  (b) Added backward/forward buttons at the end of a level-page
- repeating an exercise that has been passed, does not longer vanish scores.
- the level progress is now indicated by a linear progress bar on the top
- icons in exercises, definitions have been removed
- added MBL syntax to force special keyboards (e.g. with "`^(`"-key).
- leaving the current unit does not vanish all progress anymore
- vertical alignment of bullet points in itemize lists has been improved
- level overview: a lock symbol for non-accessible levels is shown. Currently, at least 50 % must be reached to pass a level. NOTE: Since the progress can not be persisted yet, also locked levels can be opened.
- LL-parsing of unary-minus wrongly used an unary expression as operand, instead of a multiply-expression (e.g. "-x/y" war wrongly parsed to "(-x)/y" instead of "-(x/y)")
- added a tutorial template
- added button to repeat randomized exercises
- progress within level is now shown
- progress in level overview is now shown
- keyboard: non-numeric chars/strings are now separated by "_" (e.g. "isqrt(" -> "i _ sqrt(")
- invalid term inputs are now marked by a border at top and bottom of the input field
- permanent headers (top bar + level navigation bar) consumed too much vertical space on small screens
- level overview: icons are rearranged to fill 4 columns max
- level overview graph now shows edges
- smpl doc: define sets as "{...}"; "set(..)" is forbidden now, ...
- TeX: $e^{\frac12}$
- output source row number for SMPL-errors
- report error for exercises that have no instances
- some figures are rendered too wide (overflow)
- support for new glyphs in TeX: "?", "\Longleftrightarrow"
- inline math support for the TeX engine
- enable switch display/inline TeX support in compiler and app
- support for "build-term: true" in exercises (back end)
- references to equations, sections, ...
- web application has blue (not red) background when loading
- indexing bug for more than one multiple/single choice answer in one exercise
- itemize/enumerate/... dot/number/letter is incorrectly aligned vertically
- allow input field editing at arbitrary cursor positions
- word wrapping for single/multiple choice answers
- hide/opacity non-active exercises
- keyboard key press animation
- show current position of vertical scrolling
- support for chapters (currently only levels are supported)
